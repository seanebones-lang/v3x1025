# Service Manual - Common Procedures

## Oil Change Procedure

### Recommended Intervals
- Conventional Oil: Every 3,000-5,000 miles
- Synthetic Blend: Every 5,000-7,500 miles
- Full Synthetic: Every 7,500-10,000 miles
- Severe Conditions: Reduce interval by 25%

### Procedure
1. Warm engine to operating temperature
2. Lift vehicle on hoist (ensure proper support points)
3. Locate and remove drain plug (use proper socket size)
4. Allow oil to drain completely (minimum 5 minutes)
5. Replace drain plug with new crush washer (torque to spec)
6. Remove old oil filter (check for debris)
7. Lubricate new filter gasket with clean oil
8. Install new filter (hand-tighten plus 3/4 turn)
9. Add manufacturer-specified oil type and quantity
10. Start engine and check for leaks
11. Check oil level after 3-5 minutes
12. Reset maintenance reminder system

### Common Oil Specifications
- 0W-20: Most modern Toyota, Honda, Mazda
- 5W-30: Most domestic vehicles, older imports
- 5W-40: High-performance applications
- 0W-40: European vehicles (BMW, Mercedes, Audi)

## Tire Rotation

### Rotation Patterns
- Front-Wheel Drive: Front to back, cross in rear
- Rear-Wheel Drive: Cross front to back
- All-Wheel Drive: X-pattern rotation
- Directional Tires: Front to back same side only

### Procedure
1. Check tire pressure when cold
2. Mark tire positions before removal
3. Loosen lug nuts before lifting
4. Lift vehicle using proper jack points
5. Remove wheels in sequence
6. Inspect brakes, suspension, and tire condition
7. Rotate according to pattern
8. Torque lug nuts to manufacturer spec (typically 80-100 ft-lbs)
9. Lower vehicle
10. Final torque check after lowering
11. Reset tire pressure monitoring system if required

## Brake Inspection

### Inspection Points
- Brake pad thickness (replace below 3mm)
- Rotor thickness and condition (check for scoring)
- Brake fluid level and condition
- Caliper operation and slide pins
- Brake lines for leaks or damage
- Parking brake operation

### Warning Signs
- Squealing or grinding noises
- Pulsation when braking
- Vehicle pulls to one side
- Brake pedal feels soft or spongy
- Brake warning light illuminated
- Burning smell after braking

### Brake Fluid Service
- Check level every oil change
- Replace every 2-3 years or 30,000 miles
- Use DOT 3 or DOT 4 as specified
- Never mix different types
- Brake fluid is hygroscopic (absorbs moisture)

## Battery Service

### Testing
- Visual inspection for corrosion or damage
- Load test (battery should maintain 9.6V under load)
- Charging system test (13.5-14.5V at idle)
- Parasitic draw test (should be under 50mA)

### Maintenance
- Clean terminals with wire brush and baking soda solution
- Apply terminal protector after cleaning
- Check mounting hardware for security
- Verify proper ventilation around battery

### Replacement Indicators
- Battery age over 4-5 years
- Slow cranking in cold weather
- Dim lights at idle
- Failed load test
- Visible swelling or leaking

## Air Filter Replacement

### Inspection Interval
- Check every oil change
- Replace every 15,000-30,000 miles
- More frequent in dusty conditions
- Inspect after off-road use

### Procedure
1. Locate air filter housing
2. Release clips or remove screws
3. Remove old filter
4. Clean housing with compressed air or vacuum
5. Check housing for cracks or damage
6. Install new filter (ensure proper seating)
7. Ensure arrows point toward engine
8. Secure housing cover
9. Check for proper seal

## Coolant Service

### Service Intervals
- Check level monthly
- Replace every 30,000-60,000 miles (varies by type)
- Extended-life coolant: Up to 100,000 miles
- Flush if contaminated or wrong type mixed

### Types
- Green: Traditional ethylene glycol (2-3 year life)
- Orange (Dex-Cool): 5-year extended life
- Pink/Blue: Manufacturer-specific formulations
- Never mix different types

### Procedure
1. Ensure engine is completely cool
2. Place drain pan under radiator
3. Open radiator drain cock or remove lower hose
4. Allow to drain completely
5. Close drain and fill with water
6. Run engine to operating temperature
7. Drain again (flush process)
8. Fill with 50/50 coolant mix
9. Bleed air from system per manufacturer procedure
10. Check for leaks after reaching operating temperature

## Common Torque Specifications

### Wheel Lug Nuts
- Compact cars: 80 ft-lbs
- Midsize cars: 90-100 ft-lbs
- SUVs/Trucks: 100-140 ft-lbs
- Always verify in owner's manual

### Oil Drain Plugs
- Standard: 25-30 ft-lbs
- Aluminum oil pans: 20-25 ft-lbs
- Overtightening can strip threads

### Spark Plugs
- Standard: 15-20 ft-lbs
- Tapered seat: 7-15 ft-lbs
- Aluminum heads: Lower end of range

## Safety Reminders

- Always use proper personal protective equipment
- Ensure vehicle is properly supported before working underneath
- Never work on hot engines
- Dispose of fluids properly according to local regulations
- Consult service manual for vehicle-specific procedures
- Use factory-specified parts and fluids when possible
