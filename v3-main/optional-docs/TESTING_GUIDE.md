## 1. TESTING OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Testing Philosophy

This testing framework is designed to validate system behavior under every conceivable failure condition. The system must prove it can meet documented SLAs or documentation must be corrected to reflect actual tested performance.

**Core Principles:**
- **Assume Failure:** Every component will fail - test recovery mechanisms
- **Stress Beyond Limits:** Test at 10x documented capacity to find breaking points
- **Validate Claims:** Every performance claim must be proven under stress
- **No Marketing:** Only document what has been tested and proven
- **Recovery Focus:** Self-healing must be automatic and within documented timeframes

### 1.2 Test Categories

**FUNCTIONAL TESTING**
- Unit tests with 95%+ code coverage
- Integration tests for all service interactions
- End-to-end workflow validation
- API contract testing with OpenAPI validation

**PERFORMANCE TESTING**
- Load testing at documented capacity limits
- Stress testing at 10x normal load
- Volume testing with maximum data sets
- Endurance testing over 72-hour periods

**RELIABILITY TESTING**
- Chaos engineering with random failure injection
- Disaster recovery with complete system restoration
- High availability testing with planned outages
- Data consistency validation under network partitions

**SECURITY TESTING**
- Penetration testing against all attack vectors
- Authentication and authorization boundary testing
- Input validation with malicious payload injection
- Audit trail validation under attack conditions

### 1.3 Test Environment Requirements

**Production Mirror Environment:**
- Identical hardware specifications to production
- Same network topology and latency characteristics
- Full external service integration (not mocked)
- Complete monitoring and alerting stack
- Realistic data volumes and tenant configurations

**Minimum Test Infrastructure:**
- Kubernetes cluster: 12 nodes, 48 cores, 192GB RAM
- PostgreSQL: Master + 2 replicas with 1TB storage
- Redis: 6-node cluster with persistence enabled
- Kafka: 3-broker cluster with replication factor 3
- Load generators: Separate cluster for test traffic generation
