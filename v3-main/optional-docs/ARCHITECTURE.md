## 1. ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW

### 1.1 System Design Philosophy

The Enterprise RAG System employs a microservices architecture designed for high availability, horizontal scalability, and operational excellence. The system follows cloud-native design principles with event-driven communication patterns and comprehensive observability.

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Fault Tolerance:** No single point of failure in critical paths
- **Scalability:** Linear scaling with demand across all components
- **Security:** Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive audit logging
- **Performance:** Sub-second response times under normal operating conditions
- **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns and modular design
