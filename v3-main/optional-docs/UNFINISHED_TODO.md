## CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES AND BLOCKERS

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES
1. **Kubernetes Deployments** - Production deployment capability
2. **CI/CD Pipeline** - Automated deployment to contractor environments
3. **Terraform Infrastructure** - Cloud resource provisioning
4. **Environment Configuration** - Multi-environment setup

### DEPENDENCY CHAIN STATUS
- **Core RAG Pipeline**: Complete (embed → retrieve → generate)
- **API Layer**: Complete with full functionality
- **DMS Integration**: Complete with all major providers
- **Infrastructure**: 0% complete - blocking production deployment
- **Testing Framework**: 20% complete - blocking quality assurance
- **Monitoring**: 0% complete - blocking production observability

## CONTRACTOR DELIVERY READINESS

### READY FOR DELIVERY
- Core RAG system with all components
- Production-ready API with authentication
- DMS integration for major providers (CDK, Reynolds)
- Comprehensive documentation and configuration

### BLOCKING DELIVERY
- No deployment infrastructure (K8s manifests)
- No automated deployment pipeline
- Limited testing framework
- No production monitoring setup

### ESTIMATED COMPLETION TIME
- **Infrastructure Components**: 2-3 days
- **Testing Framework**: 1-2 days  
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: 1 day
- **Documentation Updates**: 0.5 days

**Total Remaining Work**: 5-7 days for full production readiness
